**Description and Objective:** Create a song, or transcribe a song by programming, which involves Sonic Pi. The source seems most likely a tutorial, which probably has "code along" parts. According to the description, there are 4 chapters, each are about 1.5-2 hours, making it a total of 6-8 hours. It also has troubleshooting solutions just in case. My target audience would most likely be other musicians and coding students, as it is an example of how music and technology can be combined. I will use the steps in the links I've attached above to install Sonic Pi. I've looked over it and saw some examples as well, such as using basic music notation like **"play (C5)"** and **"play (Fs5)"** (For F#5). How I should be assessed would be by creating a song or a piece that is recognizable and show the accuracy and detailed each note/code functions as.
