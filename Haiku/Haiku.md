# Assignment Haiku Markdown File

Overall not too hard of an assignment. Found a haiku called *If Not for the Cat* by Jack Prelutsky

*If not for the cat,*
*And the scarcity of cheese,*
*I could be content.*

Afterwards I followed the *aiff recording demo.png* to understand the path. At first it didn't work because I forgot the space between 'say' and 'v-' so I redid it and it worked. I decided to redo the command and picked out a different voice using "say -v?" and picked Moari, with an Irish-English voice. I redid the same thing but replaced Ellen with Moari. When I named the aiff file as Haiku, I realized that I had the older one still there and so I just named it Haiku2.aiff and it worked.
