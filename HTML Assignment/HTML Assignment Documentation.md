**Documentation**
Not going to lie it was a little hectic. We all kind of forgot how to create a branch, and I think the majority of it was making sure everyone was on the right page and up to date which was a little difficult since some people were having some issues. Also, since I was the host for the website project, there were different problems that I faced, such as making sure my partners were also collaborators, which felt like we missed a step as two of us were able to open up my repository through GitHub Desktop and apparently able to create a branch without being a collaborator. Overall, it seemed like everyone was at a different spot and a little lost.
